# Starter kit Flutter

This an **experimental** open-source project contains different tools that allow you to quickly start an app in flutter.

The tools are separated in different packages or project:

| TOOL NAME                                  | TYPE                | STATE                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [base_misc][base_misc]                     | folder & base files | in-progress                    |
| [drip][drip]                               | state management    | complete - notest - no-example |
| [nautilus][nautilus]                       | navigator           | in-progress                    |
| [pocket][pocket]                           | DataBase adapter    | complete - notest- no-example  |
| [projectile][projectile]                   | Network adapter     | complete - notest              |
| [reusable_ui_flutter][reusable_ui_flutter] | widgets and views   | in-progress                    |
| [argo][argo]                               | responsive tools    | complete                       |

In the future more tools will be added or current tools will be improved.
Multiple examples for packages will be created in [examples][examples]

You can find more cool flutter UI examples in this project: [flutter_ui_challenges][flutter_ui_challenges].

## Examples


## How to contribute
This is an experimental project, and the main idea is learning. 
- Propose more package solutions
- Report errors
- Create more examples
- Improve the documentation.
- Share with other persons

## How to use a package

Remember this an experimental, and I recommend you think very well if one of these packages can be a solution for your project. For the moment none of this are in the pub.dev. 



You can add in your project via path:
**Replace** for the *package* you want to include in you project with one from the following list:
- drip
- projectile
- pocket
- nautilus

```
packageName:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/jamescardona11/starter_kit_flutter.git
      path: packageName/
```
The oficial documentation:
https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#git-packages
