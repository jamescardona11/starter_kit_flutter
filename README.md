# Starter kit Flutter

This open-source project contains different tools that allow you to quickly start an app in flutter.

The tools are separated like this:

| TOOL NAME                                  | TYPE                | STATE                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [base_misc][base_misc]                     | folder & base files | in-progress                    |
| [drip][drip]                               | state management    | complete - notest - no-example |
| [nautilus][nautilus]                       | navigator           | in-progress                    |
| [pocket][pocket]                           | adapter DB          | complete - notest- no-example  |
| [projectile][projectile]                   | adapter network     | complete - notest              |
| [reusable_ui_flutter][reusable_ui_flutter] | widgets and views   | in-progress                    |

In the future more tools will be added or current tools will be improved.
All examples for libraries will be created in [examples][examples]

Flutter is a game-changing technology that will revolutionize not just development, but software itself. A big thank you to the Flutter team for building such an amazing platform ðŸ’™
